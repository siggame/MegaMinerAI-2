# Definitions of space and distance
    * The game takes place on a grid of squares, with the lower left corner being (0,0) and the upper right corner being (25, 25).  This is a 26 by 26 grid.
    * All distance's are Manhattan distance, which is the number of squares that would have to be traversed to get from beginning to end traveling only up, down, left, or right.
    * Adjacent means a Manhattan distance of 1, which is one square up, down, left, or right.  Diagonal squares are NOT adjacent.

# Initial Conditions
    * Player 0 starts with a red unit in (0,0) and a green unit in (1,0).
    * Player 1 starts with a red unit in (25,25) and a green unit in (24,25).
    * A build point is given to the unit in (25,25).
    * Player 0 takes gets the first turn.

# Win Conditions
    * The game ends when one team loses its last unit or at 400 turns.
    * The player who has earned the most build points overall (spend or unspent) wins the game.
    * The player who did not get to have the first turn wins ties.

# Unit Stats
    * The formulas below are a guideline - they may have changed since the creation of this document. For an up to date listing of formulas, call Parser::instance()->formulas() in your code.
    
    * R = red, G = green, B = blue, Y = yellow
    * Max Health:    (15*G)+50
    * Max Moves:     (1*B)+2
    * Attack Power:  (6*R)+20
    * Attack Range:  (1*Y)+1
    * Heal Power:    (8*min(G, Y))+0
    * Poison Power:  (6*min(R, B))+0
    * Max Regen:     (3*min(B, G))+0
    * Splash Damage: (4*min(Y, R))+0
    * Level = R + G + B + Y
    * MaxBuildPoints = (Level * 3)    

# Beginning of Each Turn
    * For each unit under the current player's control
          o Each recieves its maximum number of turns
          o Each is given one action. (used for attacking, combining, or building)
          o Each is given HP equal to its regen minus its poison points
          o Poison points for each unit is divided by two and rounded down
          o Each on a build zone recieves build points

# End of Each Turn
    * All units lose all of their moves and actions.

# Reproduction / Building
    * Each unit will be able to reproduce by using a build ability and targeting an empty adjacent square.  This unit will be referred to as the builder.
    * The builder must use an action, and must use build points equal to the maximum number of build points that the builder can hold.
    * A new unit is created in the target location with no moves or actions and with the following color components
          o New unit's Red is equal to Builder's Yellow
          o New unit's Blue is equal to Builder's Red
          o New unit's Green is equal to Builder's Blue
          o New unit's Yellow is equal to Builder's Green
    * Units of any level can use the build ability

# Combining
    * Any unit may use the combine ability on any adjacent square containing an ally.
    * Both the caster and the target of combine must use an action.

# Deleveling / Uncombining
    * There will be no way to delevel or uncombine.  If you lose all your level 1 units, you have a slight reproductive disadvantage, but no critical functionality is lost.

# Movement
    * Only one unit is allowed in each square.
    * Each player can move every unit under his or her control every turn.
    * At the beginning of each turn, every unit under the current player's control is given their maximum number of moves.
    * With each move, a unit may move a single square up, down, left, or right, but NOT diagonally.

# Combat
    * Attacking requires an action.  (attacking does not require a move)
    * Attacks will target a square on the board
    * At least one of the following conditions must be true or the attack will fail.
          o The target must be an adjacent square
          o The target must be within the attacker's range (using Manhattan distance) and the attacker must have its maximum number of moves available for use. If a unit has moved, it cannot perform a ranged attack.

    * The attacker loses all remaining moves.
    * If the target contains no allies
          o Any enemy in the target square recieve damage equal to the attacker's Attack.
          o Any enemy in the target square recieve poison points equal to the attacker's Poison.
          o Any enemies in adjacent (NOT diagonal) squares will recieve damage equal to the attacker's Splash.
    * If the target contains an ally unit
          o The allied unit recieves HP equal to the attacker's Heal.
