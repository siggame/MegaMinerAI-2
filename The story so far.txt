Our story takes place a little after our last story. After building your grand statue and rightfully winning your father's kingdom, you stood at your coronation ceremony. But 'lo! As you are about to be crowned your father appears! He had been alive this whole time and was unhappy with the socio-economic terror you wrought in building the statue. So great was his unhappiness that he banished you to the magical wilderness of the Marktwainational Forest.

There you met a druid who taught you how to harness the power of nature... to create artificial servants! You realized the solution: if you couldn't have your father's kingdom you'd build your own. Thus, using the lodestone deposits of the forest, you made magical robots to use the lodestone deposits to make magical robots to use the lodestone deposits to make magical robots...! Laughing as your new contraptions began working, you looked across the clearing. Your evil brother had come to the same idea! Now you must show him who the master golemcraftsmen is and again stop him from stealing your kingdom.
